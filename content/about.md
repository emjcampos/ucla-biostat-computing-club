The UCLA Biostatistics Computing Club hosts casual seminars focusing on computational topics. We apsire to encourage and support students interested in learning or sharing their knowledge of R, Julia, Python, and beyond. These tutorials serve to bring students up to speed as well as introduce advanced problems. 

This year's organizer is [Emilie Campos](https://emjcampos.netlify.com). Emilie is a third-year PhD student in the UCLA Biostat department. A schedule for this upcoming Spring quarter is below. If you would like to sign-up to give a presentation, add your name and topic to this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BPZRYpOmuEOYZQa4weIla8gprCbUuxd52V-8Ww22EZs/edit?usp=sharing) and if you would like to suggest topics that you would like to see covered in the future, you can contact [Emilie](mailto:ejcampos@ucla.edu).
